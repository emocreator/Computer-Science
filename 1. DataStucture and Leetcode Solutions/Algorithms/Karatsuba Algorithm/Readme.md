# Karatsuba Multiplication Algorithm

This Python file contains an implementation of the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm, which is a fast multiplication algorithm that multiplies two numbers in a more efficient manner than the standard long multiplication method. The algorithm works by recursively breaking down the multiplication process into smaller subproblems and combining the results using a formula that reduces the number of multiplication operations needed.

## Algorithm Description

The Karatsuba algorithm reduces the number of recursive calls by exploiting properties of multiplication. It follows these steps:

1. **Splitting**: Split the given numbers into two halves at the middle.
2. **Recursion**: Recursively compute the products of these halves.
3. **Combination**: Combine the results using Karatsuba's formula to obtain the final product.

## Usage

The `_Multiply` class in the `Multiplication_Algorithm.py` file contains the implementation of the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm. To use it:

1. Import the `_Multiply` class into your Python script or interactive session.
2. Create an instance of the `_Multiply` class.
3. Call the `_Karatsuba_Method` method with the numbers you want to multiply.

Example usage:
```python
from Multiplication_Algorithm import _Multiply

multiply = _Multiply()
result = multiply._Karatsuba_Method(1234, 5678)
print("Result of multiplication:", result)
