## Utilising Economic Development and Population Size to Predict Plastics mismanagement.

This notebook presents my solution to Uni Coursework it includes detailed exploration's and visualization of various machine learning models and techniques. The primary focus is on regression problems, and the following methods are covered:

- **Linear Regression:** A foundational algorithm for regression problems.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** An ensemble method that builds sequential trees to minimize error.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** A kernel-based regression model.
- **Neural Network:** Delving into various aspects of neural networks, such as:
  - Activations: Discussion on activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and Sigmoid.
  - Number of Neurons: Adjusting neuron count to improve model performance.
  - Regularization: Techniques to prevent overfitting in neural networks and more.
- **Fine-tuning:** Special focus on adjusting the learning rate to enhance model performance.

Please focus on the techniques that most interest you.
